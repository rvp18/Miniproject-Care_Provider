**Chapter 1** 

**Introduction**

Nowadays, every technical field is trying to style human life at ease. With the rapid growth in the use of the internet and the technologies associated with it, several opportunities are coming up in the web or mobile application. In today’s busy life we are in a great rush to make money. But in the end, we are unable to spare time for our loved ones. As we are unknowingly ignoring this issue and care for our loved ones is important. So, we have come over with the idea to provide care for everyone in need. The application “We Care” is developed to bridge the gap between caregivers and the people who need care. In a more efficient and manageable way. By using this application we can reduce the manual search for professional and trustworthy caregivers, who will look out for your loved ones in your absence. 

We Care website is designed to bridge the gap between caregivers, caretakers, and customers.  This  website  provides  caregivers  for  any  time  period.  This  System  divides household care into five main categories. These categories are Child Care, Elder Care, Tutor, Housekeeping, Day Care, and Pet Care. We Care aims to help everyone who needs a perfect caretaker for their loved ones. 

We Care will become an important application for any individual to find the care instantly at the moment of need. Users need not waste their time in finding the care at  the moment of need. Our caregiving website will provide various options to the user. These options will be based on the filters provided by users. The caregivers are provided according to categories. These caregivers will help the user to take care of their loved ones in their absence.

**Literature Review:** 

**[1]THE CHANGE FOUNDATION (Profile of Family caregivers - report):** 

Family caregivers are people, family, and neighbors who provide critical and often ongoing personal, social, and physical support, assistance, and care, without pay, for family members and friends in need of support due to frailty, illness, or physical/cognitive disability circumstances. 

Family caregivers are a vital part of society. They are important to their loved one(s), to the healthcare system, and to the economy. They give up personal time and resources to care for someone else who is in need. 

**[2]Mobile phone apps for family caregivers:** 

The growth of mHealth apps has been exponential in recent years, but there is limited knowledge regarding the availability, functionality, and quality of apps to support family caregivers. Our objectives were to identify the apps currently available to support family caregivers and to analyze the app functions and evaluation claims. 

Family caregivers face challenges balancing care for their loved one(s) with their existing personal and work duties, which may cause negative health effects both physically and psychologically. Mobile health applications (mHealth apps) may be one solution to help family caregivers care for their loved one(s) and themselves. mHealth, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) is: “medical and public health practice supported by mobile  devices,  such  as  mobile  phones,  patient  monitoring  devices,  personal  digital assistants, and other wireless devices.” In recent years, there has been a steady increase in the  number  of  mHealth  apps.  In  particular,  the  coronavirus  disease  (COVID-19)  has accelerated the development and adoption of technology in healthcare worldwide.

**[3]An IoT-based health care system for elderly people:** 

The Internet of Things is a new reality that is completely changing our everyday life, and  promises  to  revolutionize  modern  healthcare  by  enabling  a  more  personalized, preventive and collaborative form of care. Aiming to combine these two important topics, this work presents an IoT-ready solution for the elderly living assistance which is able to monitor and register patients vital information as well as to provide mechanisms to trigger alarms in emergency situations.

**Proposed System** 

1. User Friendly: 
- Simple and interactive user interface. 
- All services provided at one place. 
2. Categories: 
   1. Select Services according to your requirements. 
2. Personalization: 
   1. We provide customizable services. 
2. Location Base search: 
- Customer can find the nearest available service person in their locality to avail the service nearest to them. 

**Requirement Analysis:** 

There are three main stages in conducting a thorough requirements analysis: 

1. The  first  step  is  to  gather  the  requirements  by  collecting  business  process documentation and conducting interviews with stakeholders.
1. Next,  analyze  and  validate  the  requirements,  evaluating  whether  they're  clear, complete, consistent, and unambiguous.
1. Finally, record the requirements and monitor their implementation throughout the project.
1. **Data flow program**: A data flow program (DFP) defines the project scope without delving into elaborate details.
1. **Use cases**: Use cases can help define system behavior and communicate from the end user's perspective.

**FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS** 

1. They are the key functions without which, the app would not function, or do what it is supposed to do.** 
1. These are requirements that must be met, and cannot be done without**.**
